/**
 * Reference to other schema components.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are mainly two different types of references. One is
 * the direct reference, which is only possible when schema components
 * are already available when references are made.
 * The other is the lazy reference, which keeps references by names
 * and later look for the component by name.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class defines interfaces that define the behavior of such
 * references and classes that implement direct reference semantics.
