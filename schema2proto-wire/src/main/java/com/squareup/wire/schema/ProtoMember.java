/**
 * Identifies a field, enum or RPC on a declaring type. Members are encoded as strings containing a type name, a hash, and a member name, like
 * {@code squareup.dinosaurs.Dinosaur#length_meters}.
 *
 * <p>
 * A member's name is typically a simple name like "length_meters" or "packed". If the member field is an extension to its type, that name is prefixed with its
 * enclosing package. This yields a member name with two packages, like {@code google.protobuf.FieldOptions#squareup.units.unit}.
